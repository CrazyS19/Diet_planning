                                    The theory is that most modern diseases can be linked to the Western diet and the consumption of grains, dairy, and processed foods.
                                    It is linked to several impressive health benefits.
                                <br><br>
                                The paleo diet emphasizes whole foods, lean protein, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds, while discouraging processed foods, sugar, dairy, 
                                    and grains. Some more flexible versions of the paleo diet also allow for dairy like cheese and butter, as well as tubers like potatoes and 
                                    sweet potatoes.

                                Veganism is the strictest form of vegetarianism.
                                The vegan diet restricts all animal products for ethical, environmental, or health reasons.
                                Veganism is also associated with resistance to animal exploitation and cruelty.

                                In addition to eliminating meat, it eliminates dairy, eggs, and animal-derived products, such as 
                                gelatin, honey, albumin, whey, casein, and some forms of vitamin D3.They may cause weight loss due to lower calorie intake

                            <p class="para" id="para3">A low-fat diet restricts your consumption of fat to under 10% of daily calories.
                                Generally, a low-fat diet provides around 30% of its calories as fat. 
                                A low-fat diet contains 10% or fewer calories from fat.

                                The diet is mostly plant-based and has a limited intake of animal products.
                                Therefore, it’s generally very high in carbs — around 80% of calories — and low in protein — at 10% of calories.
                                It can cause significant weight loss and may also have impressive benefits for heart disease, type 2 diabetes,

                                How long you stay in each phase depends on how much weight you need to lose. Each phase has its own dietary pattern.
                            <br><br>The weight loss phases are primarily based on eating unlimited high-protein foods and mandatory oat bran.
                                The other phases involve adding non-starchy 
                                vegetables followed by some carbs and fat. Later on, there will be fewer and fewer pure protein days to maintain your new weight.
                                The diet may cause weight loss, but it also may slow down your metabolism and make you lose muscle mass along with fat mass.</p>

                                Its proponents insist that you can lose weight by eating as much protein and fat as you like, as long as you avoid carbs.                          
                            <br><br>The Atkins diet is split into four phases. It starts with an induction phase, during which you eat under 20 grams of carbs per day for two weeks.
                                The other phases involve slowly reintroducing healthy carbs back into your diet as you approach your goal weight.
                                It’s effective for weight loss but also has benefits for many other disease risk factors.</p>
